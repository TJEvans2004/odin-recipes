  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    
This baked mac and cheese is a quintessential comfort dish that combines tender elbow macaroni with a rich, velvety cheese sauce. The pasta is generously coated in a creamy blend of melted cheeses, creating a smooth and indulgent texture. Once baked, the top develops a perfectly crispy, golden-brown crust, adding a delightful crunch to each bite. The result is a warm and satisfying dish that balances gooey, cheesy goodness with a savory, toasted topping, making it a truly comforting and flavorful meal.

 <h3>Recipe</h3>
 <ul>
   <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
   <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
   <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
   <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
   <li>1 cup shredded Gruyère cheese </li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
   <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs </li>
   <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
 </ul>

 <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>

  <li>In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 minute, until it forms a paste (roux).</li>
  <li>Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream, continuing to whisk until the mixture is smooth and starts to thicken, about 5 minutes.</li>

  <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce, stirring until well-coated.</li>
  <li>In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. This mixture will create a crispy topping.</li>
  <li>Pour the macaroni and cheese mixture into a greased baking dish.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the top.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
