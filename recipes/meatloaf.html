  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This meatloaf boasts a golden-brown crust that's perfectly crispy on the outside and tender within.
    Each slice reveals a juicy, savory blend of seasoned beef and pork, flecked with caramelized onions and garlic. Topped with a tangy, sweet glaze of ketchup and brown sugar that has baked into a delightful crust, this meatloaf delivers a symphony of flavors. Its moist, steaming center pairs beautifully with creamy mashed potatoes and buttery green beans,
    making each bite an irresistibly comforting experience.

 <h3>Recipe</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef</li>
  <li>1/2 lb (225 g) ground pork</li>
  <li>1 cup (120 g) breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (60 g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) milk</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) ketchup</li>
  <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Instructions</h3>
 <ol>
   <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C).</li>  
   <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef and pork. Add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, chopped onion, minced garlic, milk, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, dried thyme, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix gently until all ingredients are well combined, being careful not to overmix.</li> 
   <li>Transfer the meat mixture to a baking dish or a lined baking sheet. Shape it into a loaf, approximately 8 inches long and 4 inches wide.</li> 
   <li>In a small bowl, mix together the ketchup, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Spread the glaze evenly over the top of the meatloaf.</li> 
   <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160째F (70째C) and the meatloaf is cooked through.</li> 
   <li>Remove the meatloaf from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute for a moist and flavorful result.</li> 
   <li>Serve your meatloaf with creamy mashed potatoes and buttered green beans, or your favorite sides.</li> 
 </ol>
