  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mom's fettuccine is a culinary masterpiece that embodies the warmth and love of home-cooked meals. The creamy, velvety sauce, rich with a perfect blend of Parmesan and fresh cream,
        clings lovingly to every strand of perfectly cooked fettuccine. Each bite delivers a harmonious symphony of flavors—subtle hints of garlic and a touch of nutmeg enhance the depth,
        while tender bits of chicken or sautéed mushrooms add satisfying texture. It’s not just a dish; it’s a comforting embrace that makes any meal feel special.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make the pasta dough</li>
  <li>On a clean surface or in a large bowl mound the flour and make a well in the center.</li>
  <li>Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt and olive oil.</li>
  <li>Gradually mix the flour into the eggs with a fork, until the dough starts to come together.</li>
  <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
  <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
  <li>Roll out the dough</li>
  <li>After resting, divide the dough into two pieces.</li>
  <li>On a floured surface, roll out each piece into a thin sheet, about 1/16 inch thick. You can also use a pasta machine if you have one, starting with the widest setting and gradually moving to thinner settings.</li>
  <li>Cut the Fettuccine</li>
  <li>Once rolled out, lightly flour the dough sheets and roll them up loosely.</li>
  <li>Slice the rolled dough into 1/4-inch wide strips to create fettuccine.</li>
  <li>Unroll the strips and toss with a bit of flour to prevent sticking.</li>
  <li>Cook the Fettuccine</li>
  <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
  <li>Add the fettuccine and cook for 2-4 minutes, or until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried pasta, so keep an eye on it.</li>
  <li>Drain the pasta and toss with a little olive oil if not serving immediately.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>

  <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally</li>
</ol>
